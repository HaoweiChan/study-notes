# Docker Containers

## Summary
Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers, enabling consistent deployment across different environments and simplifying DevOps workflows.

## Problem Statement
Traditional application deployment faces challenges with "it works on my machine" issues, environment inconsistencies, and dependency conflicts. Docker solves these problems by providing isolated, reproducible environments that package applications with all their dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across development, testing, and production environments.

## Key Concepts & Architecture

### Core Components
- **Docker Engine:** The runtime that builds and runs containers
- **Docker Images:** Read-only templates used to create containers
- **Docker Containers:** Runnable instances of Docker images
- **Dockerfile:** Text file with instructions for building Docker images
- **Docker Registry:** Storage and distribution system for Docker images
- **Docker Compose:** Tool for defining and running multi-container applications

```

## Configuration & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Linux, macOS, or Windows with Docker Desktop
- Basic understanding of command line operations
- Text editor for creating Dockerfiles

### Installation & Configuration
```bash
# Install Docker Desktop (includes Docker Engine, CLI, Compose)
# Download from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

# Verify installation
docker --version
docker-compose --version

# Basic configuration (optional)
mkdir -p ~/.docker
echo '{"experimental": "enabled"}' > ~/.docker/config.json
```

### Basic Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Use official Node.js runtime as base image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory in container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first for better layer caching
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies (this layer cached if package.json doesn't change)
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Create non-root user for security
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001

USER nextjs

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health || exit 1

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Docker Compose Configuration
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/mydb
    depends_on:
      - db
    volumes:
      - ./logs:/app/logs

  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=mydb
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data

volumes:
  db_data:
  redis_data:
```

## Usage Examples

### Common Workflows

1. **Development Workflow:** Use Docker Compose for local development with hot reloading
2. **Production Deployment:** Build optimized images and deploy to container orchestration platforms
3. **CI/CD Integration:** Build and push images as part of automated pipelines

### Code Examples

#### Node.js Application
```javascript
// app.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    version: process.env.APP_VERSION || '1.0.0'
  });
});

app.get('/api/data', async (req, res) => {
  // Simulate database call
  const data = {
    message: 'Hello from Docker container!',
    container_id: process.env.HOSTNAME
  };
  res.json(data);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port} in container ${process.env.HOSTNAME}`);
});
```

#### Multi-stage Dockerfile for Optimization
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS production
WORKDIR /app

# Create app user for security
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S nextjs -u 1001

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production && \
    npm cache clean --force

# Copy built application from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

USER nextjs

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

## Best Practices & Guidelines

### Recommended Patterns
- **Multi-stage Builds:** Use multiple stages for optimization and security
- **Layer Caching:** Order instructions to maximize cache utilization
- **Minimal Base Images:** Use Alpine or slim variants when possible
- **Non-root User:** Always run containers as non-root for security
- **Health Checks:** Implement proper health checks for orchestration
- **Environment Variables:** Use env vars instead of hardcoded values

### Security Considerations
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities
- **Secret Management:** Never store secrets in images, use volumes or env vars
- **Image Signing:** Sign and verify image authenticity
- **Network Security:** Use private registries and access controls

```bash
# Security scanning
docker scan myimage:tag

# Run as non-root
RUN useradd -r -u 1001 -g nodejs nodejs
USER nodejs
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Image Size:** Minimize layers and use appropriate base images
- **Caching Strategy:** Copy package.json first, then install dependencies
- **Resource Limits:** Set appropriate CPU and memory limits
- **Health Checks:** Implement efficient health check endpoints

```dockerfile
# Optimized Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --frozen-lockfile

FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static

USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### Common Problems

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Image won't build** | Build fails with cryptic errors | Check Dockerfile syntax and layer order |
| **Container won't start** | Container exits immediately | Review logs with `docker logs <container>` |
| **Port conflicts** | Port already in use | Use different host ports or stop conflicting containers |
| **Out of disk space** | Build fails due to storage | Clean up unused images and containers |

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# View running containers
docker ps -a

# View container logs
docker logs -f container_name

# Execute into running container
docker exec -it container_name /bin/sh

# View image layers
docker history image_name

# Clean up unused resources
docker system prune -a

# Debug build process
docker build --no-cache --progress=plain -t myimage .
```
