# Note Structure and Format

## File Organization
- Notes are organized by category in subdirectories: `notes/ml/`, `notes/algo/`, `notes/sd/`
- Categories: `ml` (machine learning), `algo` (algorithms), `sd` (system design)
- Filenames: `{slug}.md` (no dates in filenames)

## Required Frontmatter
Every note must include:
```yaml
---
title: "Your Note Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
category: "ml|algo|sd"
---
```

## Optional Frontmatter Fields
```yaml
tags: []
related: []
slug: "custom-slug"  # if different from generated slug
```

## Required Sections
Every note must have these sections:
- `# Title` (H1 heading matching the title)
- `## Summary` - 1-3 line summary
- `## Details` - Main content
- `## Examples / snippets` - Code examples with language tags

## Code Block Requirements
- All code blocks must specify a language (e.g., ```python, ```javascript)
- Use fenced code blocks with backticks
- Include helpful comments in code examples

## Template Usage
Use the helper script to create new notes:
```bash
./scripts/new_note.sh "Note Title" category [slug]
```

Example:
```bash
./scripts/new_note.sh "Kalman Filter" ml kalman-filter
```
